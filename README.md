# speckle
This programs are intended for reduction of speckle data from telescopes using R language.
Input data now is a set of 512x512 (x2 bytes) speckle images of binary and multiple stars.

speckle_vis.R - for reduction of speckle data using algorithm described in paper
["Differential photometry of speckle-interferometric binary and multiple stars"
Pluzhnik E.A., Astronomy and Astrophysics, v.431, p.587-596 (2005)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2005/08/aa1158.pdf)


speckle_gen.R - for generation of model speckle data

middle_d_f.R - for calculation of middle dark or flat field images.

All programs are still far from finish.
